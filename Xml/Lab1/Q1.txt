                                “Evil turned out not to be a grand thing.
                                 Not sneering Emperors with their world-conquering designs.
                                 Not cackling demons plotting in the darkness beyond the world.
                                 It was small men with their small acts and their small reasons.
                                 It was selfishness and carelessness and waste.
                                 It was bad luck, incompetence, and stupidity.
                                 It was violence divorced from conscience or consequence.
                                 It was high ideals, even, and low methods.”
